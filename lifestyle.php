                                <p>Food is something we all need to live. Not eating food will cause disease and even death. 
                                  There are many foods which you can eat, and there are also some that you should not. You need to make sure that the food you choose are healthy and nutritious
                                  , because they'll help your body grow and repair itself if you have a lot of energy.
                                   If you don't eat enough protein, then your body will suffer because it's lacking proteins so it can use as fuel for your muscles.
                                   Food is a big part of our lives.  </p>

                                <p>As a software developer I approach the software development process on a personal level. After  years of software development, 
                                    I know how to collaborate with businesses to accomplish their objectives.

                                    I collaborate with you as an end-to-end provider of software development solutions.

                                <p>Travelling is a great way to get away from your old life and start fresh. Travelling helps you in mind refresh and keep you away from the stress.
                                   It is a good thing to travel and see the outside world.
                                     Traveling gives us an opportunity to learn more about the culture and traditions of other countries, it also challenges our minds with many new things.
                                      It gives you a chance to think out side the box.  Learning foreign languages, exploring new places and cultures, 
                                      and being immersed in different environments.</p>
